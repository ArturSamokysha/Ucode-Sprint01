	<h2>What makes a superhero?</h2> 
		<p>
			What is a superhero? What is a supervillain? What are the traits that define and separate these two? What cultural contexts do we find them in? And why we need them? Editors Robin S. Rosenberg, PhD and Peter Coogan, PhD collected a series of essays examining these questions from both major comic book writers and editors, such as Stan Lee and Danny Fingeroth, and leading academics in psychology and cultural studies, such as Will Brooker and John Jennings. <p>The following essay by legendary comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer <b>Stan Lee</b> is extracted from <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/what-is-a-superhero-9780199795277?cc=us&lang=en&"><i>What is a Superhero?</i></a> and entitled “More Than Normal, But Believable”.</p>
